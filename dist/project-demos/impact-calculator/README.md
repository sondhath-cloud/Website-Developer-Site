# Development Services Impact Dashboard

A comprehensive visualization tool that demonstrates how daily Development Services tasks translate into real community impact through transparent, data-driven calculations.

## Overview

This dashboard solves a critical challenge for Development Services departments: making the invisible work of permits, inspections, and plan reviews visible and valued by showing their direct impact on community prosperity.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Real Impact Visualization**
- Clear connections between daily tasks and community outcomes
- Interactive impact chain showing cause-and-effect relationships
- Scenario planning to demonstrate potential improvements

### ðŸ“Š **Transparent Calculations**
- Clickable impact metrics with detailed calculation methods
- Real formulas and data sources for every number
- Comprehensive validation procedures

### ðŸ“ˆ **Key Metrics Tracked**
- **Daily Task Performance**: Processing time, approval rates, volume, satisfaction
- **Community Impact**: Jobs created, housing units built, economic development
- **Developer Savings**: Cost reductions from faster processing
- **Project Attraction**: How efficiency improvements attract more development

## How It Works

### The Impact Chain
1. **Faster Processing** â†’ Reduces developer costs through interest savings
2. **Developer Savings** â†’ Makes projects more attractive and profitable
3. **More Projects** â†’ Increases development activity in the community
4. **Community Growth** â†’ Creates jobs, housing, and economic development

### Real Calculation Example
- **Processing Time Improvement**: 5.2 â†’ 3.8 days (1.4 days saved)
- **Developer Interest Cost**: $500,000 project Ã— 8% Ã· 365 = $109.59/day
- **Savings per Project**: $109.59 Ã— 1.4 days = $153.43
- **Annual Impact**: $153.43 Ã— 342 projects = $52,473 in developer savings
- **Community Benefit**: 100 new jobs + 88 housing units + $2.3M economic impact
